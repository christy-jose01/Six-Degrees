# Six-Degrees
This program is based on an assignment from my Datastructures and Algorithms course at the University of California, Santa Cruz. This is a program that solves the “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon” game. This program parses a dataset into a graph and perform shortest path computations. Given any two actors, the aim is to find a “path” between them, consisting two actors with whom they have coacted. For example, given Brad Pitt and Rachel McAdams, one can find a “path” between them:
**Brad Pitt -(Fury: Blood Brothers)- David Ayer -(The Making of ’End of Watch’)- Jake Gyllenhaal -(Southpaw: Inside the Ring)- Rachel McAdams.**
Meaning, Brad Pitt appeared with David Ayer in “Fury: Blood Brothers”, who appeared with Jake Gyllenhaal in “The Making of ’End of Watch’”, who appeared with Rachel McAdams in “Southpaw: Inside the Ring”
